### v.1.2.1

The SAP project from the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO) obtains, analyzes and prepare the necessary information to monitor the fishery activity in Northeast Atlantic.

The biological on-shore samples are collected by a subcontracted company under the supervision of the SAP project. Before saving the data into the national database an specific revision of the data is done by SAP project.

The EM-SAP (Sampling Team of SAP project) assumes the responsibility of the correct dumping into IEO's database (SIRENO) of the sampling information a way that ensures the information saved complies with the criteria, format and protocol agreed in the team.

This script is framed in the deliberable *Data integrity, quality checkings* of the EM-SAP *Quality Assurance Framework* ([link to deliverable](http://www.proyectosap.es/index.php/documentacion-publica/send/323-quality-assurance-framework/2092-qaf-emsap-dataintegrityqualitycheckings-v1-0-0-may2019)) and is used to check the data saved before the dump process in SIRENO.

In case the script detect any error, it must be fixed by de EM-SAP staff before de dump process.
